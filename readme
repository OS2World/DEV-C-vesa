                     VESA package for emx, Version 1.8
                     ---------------------------------

This is a package that enables emx programs to call the VESA Bios extensions
under DOS. It also supplies some drivers for doing fullscreen and windowed
graphics under OS/2.

The svgakit for emx uses this package and implements some higher level
graphics routines. It should be available from the same sites as this package.


1.  Installation:
-----------------

- Unzip the package. All files should be extracted to /emx/jm/vesa.1_8
- change to the directory /emx/jm/vesa.1_8
- If you've only DOS on your computer system type "make dosinstall".
  If you've OS/2 or DOS and OS/2 type "make install".
  Wait until compilation and installation has finished. Note that
  "make install" expects the directories /emx/dll, /emx/bin, /emx/include
  and /emx/lib to exist on the current drive. "make dosinstall" expects
  the directories /emx/include and /emx/lib on the current drive.
- To build programs with the VESA package for emx read the instructions
  in section 5.

Note: Some make utilities fail to install the VESA package properly.
      If this happens, try "make install2" or "make dosinstall2"
      instead of "make install" or "make dosinstall".
      However this requires the "cp" program. It is available with
      the gnu file utilities, available from ftp.cdrom.com.
      If you don't want to install the "cp" program you'll have to
      do the last installation steps yourself:
        copy *.dll \emx\dll            (OS/2 only)
        copy pmscreen.exe \emx\bin     (OS/2 only)
        copy vesa.h \emx\include
        copy vesa.a \emx\lib
        copy vesa.lib \emx\lib

Note: To build the VESA package for emx, you need to setup the
      INCLUDE environment variable for the OS/2 resource compiler:
      SET INCLUDE=c:\emx\include
      Use backslashes, not slashes!

2.  Preparation before running programs using the VESA package for emx:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.  DOS:
----------
If your graphics card has native VESA support (i.e. VESA Bios extension
in ROM), no preparation is necessary. If not, just load your VESA Bios
extension TSR. A VESA Bios extension TSR should be on the driver disk of
your graphic card, see below, section 3.
If you don't have a VESA Bios extension TSR, only some low resolution vga
modes (i.e. 320x200x256, 640x480x16 and 800x600x16) will be supported.

2.2.  OS/2:
-----------
  "make install" will build several dynamic link libraries and will copy
  them to \emx\dll. It will also copy the file "pmscreen.exe" to /emx/bin.
  "\emx\dll" has to be mentioned in the LIBPATH statement of your CONFIG.SYS.
  "\emx\bin" should be mentioned in the PATH environment variable.

  When a program using the VESA package first calls a VESA function, it
  loads one of the following DLLs:
  - VESA_PM.DLL   ---  for all graphics adapters supported by OS/2
                       Resolutions: up to 32767x32767x256
                                    and   32767x32767x16M
                       requires PMSCREEN.EXE to be in a directory contained
                       in the PATH environment variable or the environment
                       variable PMSCREEN to point to PMSCREEN.EXE.
                       (example: "C:> set PMSCREEN=c:\emx\bin\pmscreen.exe")
                       See Section 7.
  - VESA_IBM.DLL  ---  for Standard VGA and all unsupported SVGA adapters
                       Resolutions: 640x480x16
                                    800x600x16
                                    320x200x256

                                    320x400x256
                                    360x480x256
                       800x600x16 is only supported on SVGA adapters
                       recognized by OS/2's SVGA.EXE (see OS/2 docs).

                                          1024x768x256
  - VESA_CL.DLL   ---  for Cirrus Logics GD 5422 based SVGA adapters
                       Resolutions: up to 1024x768x16
                                          1024x768x256

                                           640x480x16m
                       Note: This DLL activates hi- and true color modes
                             by direct manipulation of svga registers.
                             This may not work on all graphics adapters
                             and damage your monitor and/or graphics adapter!
                             Use of this DLL is at your OWN RISK!
  - VESA_S3.DLL   ---  for S3 based SVGA adapters
                       Resolutions: up to 1024x768x16

                       (higher resolutions may work)

  VESA_PM.DLL opens two Presentation Manager windows (one for text and one
  for graphics) to display the output of your programs. All other DLLs run
  in an OS/2 fullscreen session.

  By default, the VESA package loads "VESA_PM.DLL". If you want the VESA
  package to load another DLL specify the name of that DLL in the
  environment variable "VESADLL". For example, type "set VESADLL=VESA_ET4"
  to make the VESA package load "VESA_ET4.DLL". Note that you MUST NOT
  specify the path or the extension of the DLL.

- To test the VESA package run "VESATEST.EXE". It should show information
  on all supported video modes.
- Get the svgakit for emx. It uses this VESA package. It now supports
  all 16-, 256-, 64k- and 16m-color modes!


3.  How to get a DOS VESA Bios extension:
-----------------------------------------

If you don't have a VESA Bios extension for your graphic adapter, get the
files kjb/MGL/univbe??.zip and kjb/MGL/vesatsrs.zip from
godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au. They contain a large variety of Bios extensions
for most graphic adapters.
These files are also available from garbo.uwasa.fi and oak.oakland.edu.

If you've got a standard VGA (or if you don't find a VESA Bios extension)
you may want to use the VESA Bios extension "VESA_IBM.COM" which is included
in this package. It supports the standard VGA modes and some non-standard
modes all VGA cards are able to do.


4.  How to get an OS/2 VESA Driver:
-----------------------------------

This paragraph should be obsolete now. All graphics cards supported by OS/2
should now also be supported by the VESA package for emx using VESA_ALL.DLL
(provided you run OS/2 Warp).

If you have a graphics adapter which is not yet supported by this packages,
you have to write your own one. Don't be afraid: It is not that difficult.
If your graphics card is recognized by OS/2's SVGA.EXE it should work
like that:
- Get a DOS VESA Bios extension for your graphics card. Additional information
  on your graphics card will be helpful.
  (/kjb/MGL/vgadoc2.zip at godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au for example)
- Compile the VESA package.
- Boot DOS and run "VESATEST.EXE". Now it displays information on the
  supported graphics modes. Write it down (or use "VESATEST.EXE > XYZ.DAT")
  to pipe the output of "VESATEST.EXE" to "XYZ.DAT".
- Look at "C:\OS2\SVGADATA.PMI" and find the modes that are both supported
  by OS/2 and your VESA Bios extension (X,Y-resolution and number of colors
  should be equal).
- "Copy vesa_et4.c vesa_xxx.c" where 'xxx' is short for your graphic card.
  Now change the 'Modes' and 'ModeInfos'-Structures according to the
  information "VESATEST.EXE" gave you.
- Look at the documentation on your graphics card or debug your VESA
  Bios extension by calling interrupt 0x10 with ax=0x4f05 to see how
  Bank switching is done for your graphics card and change the functions
  "OS2VesaSetWindow" and "OS2VesaGetWindow".
  You could also look at "d:\OS2\SVGADATA.PMI".
- Change the makefile to compile and link your "vesa_xxx.c" like
  "vesa_et4.c".
- Run "make" to compile the new library. Then set the environment variable
  VESADLL to "vesa_xxx" and try to run "VESATEST.EXE". The output should be
  at least similar to the output you got when running VESATEST.EXE with DOS.
- Get the svgakit for emx and try to run "GRAPH.EXE".
- If everything works, send the source to me (see below). I'll include it
  in future releases of this VESA package.

If you don't know how to start, just contact me. I'll try to get infos on
your graphics adapter and send you some code that should work. If not, we
can try to fix the bugs together (you report the symptoms, I'll look at the
code).


5.  VESA function reference:
----------------------------

a) Look at the file "vesa.txt" in "/kjb/MGL/vgadoc2.zip" at
   godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au for reference information on the 'real'
   VESA Bios extension.

b) - To use the VESA-package with DOS you have allow direct port
     and memory access for your programs. This can be done by
     running "emxbind -aq myexe.exe -acim" after linking.
   - All DLLs except VESA_PM.DLL need your program to be run in
     an OS/2 fullscreen session. To tell OS/2 to automatically
     switch to an OS/2 fullscreen session when your program starts
     use the emxbind utility after linking your program:
     "emxbind -e -f myexe.exe"

c) Reference:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <vesa.h>                                               [emx/vesa-emx]

VESABOOL VesaInitialize(void);

    Initialize VESA-Driver. Return TRUE if sucessful, else FALSE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <vesa.h>                                               [emx/vesa-emx]

VESABOOL VesaGetInfo(PVESAINFO pVesaInfo);

    Get VESA-Driver and SuperVGA Information:

    typedef struct
      {
        VESAWORD Version;          /* VESA Version number (now 1.2) */
        VESACHAR *OEMName;         /* pointer to OEM name           */
        VESAWORD *Modes;           /* pointer to list of supported  */
      } VESAINFO, *PVESAINFO;      /* modes terminated with 0xFFFF  */

    VesaGetInfo returns TRUE on success, else FALSE. If VesaGetInfo returns
    FALSE the VESA Bios extension or emx VESA driver is not loaded (DOS only).

    See also: VesaGetInfo()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <vesa.h>                                               [emx/vesa-emx]

VESABOOL VesaGetModeInfo(VESAWORD Mode, PVESAMODEINFO pVesaModeInfo);

    Get information on specified mode. See "VESA.TXT" mentioned in a)
    for an explanation of the fields. The fields called "reserved" are not
    included here. Two fields are different from standard VESA:

    SetWindowFunc points to a function to set the current memory window.
    GetWindowFunc points to a function to get the current memory window.
    (Standard VESA has only one pointer for both "get" and "set").
    Look at VesaSetWindow and VesaGetWindow for parameters for
    SetWindowFunc and GetWindowFunc.

    typedef struct
      {
        VESAWORD ModeAttributes;
        VESACHAR WindowAAttributes;
        VESACHAR WindowBAttributes;
        VESAWORD WindowGranularity;
        VESAWORD WindowSize;
        VESAPTR  WindowAStart;
        VESAPTR  WindowBStart;
        VESASET  SetWindowFunc;
        VESAGET  GetWindowFunc;
        VESAWORD BytesPerScanline;
        VESAWORD Width;
        VESAWORD Height;
        VESACHAR CharacterWidth;
        VESACHAR CharacterHeight;
        VESACHAR NumberOfMemoryPlanes;
        VESACHAR NumberOfBitsPerPixel;
        VESACHAR NumberOfBanks;
        VESACHAR MemoryModelType;
        VESACHAR SizeOfBank;
        VESACHAR NumberofPages;
        VESACHAR RedMaskSize;
        VESACHAR RedMaskPosition;
        VESACHAR GreenMaskSize;
        VESACHAR GreenMaskPosition;
        VESACHAR BlueMaskSize;
        VESACHAR BlueMaskPosition;
        VESACHAR ReservedMaskSize;
        VESACHAR ReservedMaskPosition;
      } VESAMODEINFO, *PVESAMODEINFO;

    VesaGetModeInfo returns TRUE on success and FALSE if the requested mode
    is not supported.

    CAUTION: When running with OS/2 the WindowAStart and WindowBStart fields
       are only valid if:
       - You have activated the graphics mode by calling VesaSetMode().
       - Your application is executed in foreground (can be forced by
         calling VesaLockScreen() before calling VesaGetModeInfo();
         don't forget to call VesaUnlockScreen()).

VESABOOL VesaSetMode(VESAWORD Mode);
VESABOOL VesaGetMode(PVESAWORD Mode);

    Activate specified video mode/get current video mode.

    VesaSetMode/VesaGetMode returns TRUE on success else FALSE.

    See also: VesaGetModeInfo()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <vesa.h>                                               [emx/vesa-emx]

VESABOOL VesaSetWindow(VESACHAR Window, VESAWORD Address);
VESABOOL VesaGetWindow(VESACHAR Window, PVESAWORD Address);

    Set/Get current video memory window address.

    VesaSetWindow/VesaGetWindow returns TRUE on success else FALSE.

    CAUTION: Lock the screen via VesaLockScreen() before calling
       VesaSetWindow()/VesaGetWindow(). To increase speed these functions
       neither test if the screen is already locked nor lock it themselves.
       Calling these functions without locking the screen can cause
       unpredictable results!

#include <vesa.h>                                               [emx/vesa-emx]

VESABOOL VesaSetScanlineLength(VESAWORD NumberOfPixels);

                               PVESAWORD NumberOfScanlines);

    Set/Get logical scanline length.

    VesaSetScanlineLength/VesaGetScanlineLength returns TRUE on success
    else FALSE. If screen is not locked and program is running in
    background these functions return FALSE.

#include <vesa.h>                                               [emx/vesa-emx]

VESABOOL VesaSetSwitchFunc(VESASWITCH SwitchFunc);

    Specify a function which is called each time the user switches the
    program from background to foreground or vice versa. The function
    has to save/restore the contents of the video memory.

    Calling VesaSetSwitchFunc(NULL) causes OS/2 to save/restore the
    video memory itself (this is the default).

    'SwitchFunc' has to be defined as follows:

    void SwitchFunc(int Restore)
    {
      ...
    }

    The Parameter 'Restore' signals the function whether it should save
    (Restore = 0) or restore (Restore = 1) the video memory.

    To access the video memory from within this function you don't have
    to use screen locking.

    VesaSetSwitchFunc returns TRUE on success else FALSE.

    This function has no effect under DOS and does not belong to the
    standard VESA Bios extension.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <vesa.h>                                               [emx/vesa-emx]

VESABOOL VesaLockScreen(VESACHAR wait);

    This function locks the screen. This is required before
    accessing the screen memory. The parameter 'wait' specifies whether
    VesaLockScreen() should return with an error if the program isn't
    in foreground (wait = 0) or should wait until the program is
    switched to foreground (wait = 1).

    VesaLockScreen returns TRUE if locking was successful else FALSE
    (if wait = 0).

    This function has no effect under DOS and does not belong to the
    standard VESA Bios extension.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <vesa.h>                                               [emx/vesa-emx]

VESABOOL VesaUnlockScreen(void);

    This function unlocks the screen previously locked by VesaLockScreen().

    This function has no effect under DOS and does not belong to the
    standard VESA Bios extension.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <vesa.h>                                               [emx/vesa-emx]

VESABOOL VesaSetModified(void);

    This function tells the VESA Bios extension to update the screen.

    This function has only effect when VESA_PM.DLL is used under OS/2.
    It does not belong to the standard VESA Bios extension.

                        PVESACHAR  Palette);

    Set/Get the palette entries from StartIndex to (StartIndex +
    NumberOfEntries - 1). For each palette entry 3 bytes are taken
    from or copied to Palette in the order red, green, blue. Each byte
    should have a value between 0 and 63, inclusive.

    If Wait is non-zero VesaSetPalette waits for the vertical retrace
    to avoid snow on the screen.

    This function does not belong to the standard VESA Bios extension.

VESABOOL VesaGetCharacter(PVESACHAR pchar);

    Wait until a key is pressed and return its ASCII-Code in *pchar. If
    a function key is pressed, VesaGetCharacter returns 0 in *pchar. The
    next call to VesaGetCharacter will return the SCAN-Code of the key
    pressed.

    This function does not belong to the standard VESA Bios extension.

    Note: You may use "normal" emx, C library, or OS/2 API calls instead
          of VesaGetCharacter. However, if you want your program to work
          with VESA_PM.DLL under OS/2 you should use VesaGetCharacter.

    - bit 1 = 1 - button 2 pressed
    - bit 2 = 1 - button 3 pressed

    If wait is FALSE, MouseGetEvent returns immediately if no
    event is available and reports the current mouse position
    and button status.
    If wait is TRUE, MouseGetEvent waits until a mouse event
    occurs.

    MouseGetEvent returns TRUE if a mouse event occured,
    else FALSE.

6.  VESA_ET6.DLL:
-----------------

VESA_ET6.DLL does not use OS/2-functions to switch between video modes. It
programs the registers of the ET4000 graphics controller directly. The
information on the video modes is stored in the file "vesamode.dat". This
information may differ between different graphic adapters and monitors. So
it has to be created first. To do this, follow the following instructions:

1.Boot DOS (because "modedump.exe" uses emx, you cannot run it in
  OS/2 DOS-Fullscreen).
2.Load your VESA Bios extension.
3.Run "modedump.exe". A file called "vesamode.dat" should be created.
4.Move "vesamode.dat" to some directory mentioned in your DPATH statement
  in config.sys (I put it in C:\OS2).

CAUTION: Because VESA_ET6.DLL directly programs the graphic adapter, it
         may cause damage to your monitor!
         Never use a "vesamode.dat" on a computer+monitor other than the
         one you created the file with!
         Use of this DLL is at your OWN RISK!


7.  The VESA_PM.DLL and PMSCREEN.EXE:
-------------------------------------

When your program first calls a VESA function, the VESA library will load
VESA_PM.DLL (if you didn't specify another DLL as default, see section 2.2).
VESA_PM.DLL will start PMSCREEN.EXE. All output via stdout and stderr will
be redirected to the text window of PMSCREEN.EXE. Most input to either the
text window or the graphics window of PMSCREEN is redirected to stdin of
your program. In addition you may ask for input using VesaGetCharacter and
VesaKeyboardHit.
Do not use OS/2 VIO- and KBD-Calls. They will act in the window/fullscreen
your program was started from.

In the system menu of PMSCREEN.EXE you may choose "Update Screen" to force
PMSCREEN to update its screen.

If you choose "PM-Screen Settings" PMSCREEN will show you its settings
dialog. It contains the following entries:
- Time between screen updates:
  The screen will be updated all ... milliseconds, if neccesary (i.e.
  if the screen contents have changed, and your program correctly told
  PMSCREEN that it changed the contents).
- Use physical palette:
  If checked, PMSCREEN will modify the physical palette to best display
  the colors your programs needs.
- Use full palette:
  By default, OS/2 reserves about 20 palette entries for its own use
  and does not let your program change then. If you check this button,
  PMSCREEN will use even these 20 entries of the palette.
  At least on two machines (with ET4000 and ATI Mach64 card), this seems
  not to work correctly. The palette is only modified when PMSCREEN runs
  in background, while it should be modified when it runs in foreground...
- Display in original size:
  This tells PMSCREEN not to stretch or shrink the output of your program.
  This will increase speed and quality of the output.
- Font size:
  You can select the size of the font in PMSCREEN's text window. You may
  enter the font size in horizontal and vertical direction. PMSCREEN's
  will look for the font best matching the values entered by you. So, by
  entering (1,1) you'll get a very small font, (99,99) will select a
  large font.
  All font sizes available in OS/2 windowed sessions are available in
  PMSCREEN's text window.

You can save PMSCREEN's settings. You may specify a system default setting
and a default setting for each program using the VESA package for emx. Just
push the right button in PMSCREEN's settings dialog.

In order to be found by VESA_PM.DLL the program PMSCREEN.EXE has to be
in a directory mentioned in the PATH environment variable or the environment
variable PMSCREEN must contain path and filename of PMSCREEN.EXE.

To enable other than the standard resolutions in PMSCREEN.EXE you may
also set the PMSCRMOD environment variable. It may contain a semicolon
separated list of mode descriptions in the following fomat:

    <Hex Mode Number>,<X Resolution>,<Y Resolution>,<Bits Per Pixel>
where                      is
      Hex Mode Number         any hex number from 0x0 to 0xFFFE except 0x3
      X Resolution            any number from 1 to 32767
      Y Resolution            any number from 1 to 32767
      Bits Per Pixel          8 or 24.

Examples:
    - set PMSCRMOD=200,1600,1280,24
      Defines Mode 0x200 as 1600 * 1280 pixels with 16M colors.
    - set PMSCRMOD=200,1600,1280,8;201,32767,32767,24
      Defines Mode 0x200 as 1600 * 1280 pixels with 256 colors,
          and Mode 0x201 as 32767 * 32767 pixels with 16M colors
          (requires about 3.2 GByte of memory, not tested...)

If you specify modes using the PMSCRMOD environment variable the standard
modes (except text mode 0x03) will be disabled.


8.  Known Problems (under OS/2):
--------------------------------

PMSCREEN.EXE/VESA-PM.DLL:
- stdin redirection (PMSCREEN to your program) doesn't work as it should;
  no echo, no line editor.
  This will hopefully be fixed in a future version.

VESA-ALL.DLL:
- it's difficult to determine the scanline length for the non standard
  graphics modes. I couldn't find an appropiate OS/2 function and the
  data for the scanline length in svgadata.pmi seems to be junk.

all excect VESA-PM.DLL:
- problems switching back from hi-res graphics mode to text mode. Screen
  displays garbage or nothing at all. Switching to another session and
  back might help.
- printf("\a") (and similar) does not create a beep in graphics mode.
  Use OS/2's DosBeep() instead.


9.  History:
------------

Version 1.1 (04/03/1993):
  - initial release
Version 1.2 (04/13/1993):
  - Bug fixed in vesa_*.dll:
    if VesaSetScanLineLength can't set the desired scanline length
    it has to set the first possible GREATER than the desired (was LOWER)
  - Included standard VGA non-bios modes 320x240x256, 320x400x256
    and 360x480x256 in vesa_ibm.dll.
Version 1.3 (05/14/1993)
  - VESA_IBM.COM and VESA_EMX.COM now check if they are already installed
  - mode information on standard vesa modes and standard vga modes (12h,13h)
    now included in libvesa.a:
    - should solve problems with some VESA Bios extensions
    - modes 12h and 13h now available with any VESA Bios extension
  - new VESA_TR8.DLL for graphics adapters with Trident 8900 chipset (beta)
